# Smart-Flashlight

Goal: to create a self-adjusting flashlight

The idea was to make flashlight that self-adjusts its brightness for maximum visibility, while being energy efficient
In a dark room, the light would get brighter
In a bright room, the light would get dimmer

I used an LED as the bulb, a photoresistor, and a fixed 10K resistor (it's the 'fixed' resistor in the volage divider circuit)

My aim was to make this circuit more compact and mount it on a RC robot I plan on making. 
The robot will also have a camera so I can see what it sees in real time. 
The light and camera may be mounted on a servo so it can sweep the area with the light and allow me to see everything
