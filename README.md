# Smart-Flashlight

Goal:
To create a self-adjusting flashlight

The idea was to make flashlight that self-adjusts its brightness for maximum visibility, while being energy efficient
In a dark room, the light would get brighter
In a bright room, the light would get dimmer

Method/Equipment:
I used an LED as the bulb, a photoresistor, a resistor for the LED, and a fixed 10K resistor (it's the 'fixed' resistor in the volage divider circuit)

Results:
The LED was off when my lamp was on. 
The LED then turned on when I turned off my lamp.
As I covered up the LDR, the LED got brighter, and as I exposed it to more light, it became dimmer.

It worked!


Future Plans: 
My aim was to make this circuit more compact and mount it on a RC robot I plan on making. 
The robot will also have a camera so I can see what it sees in real time. 
The light and camera may be mounted on a servo so it can sweep the area with the light and allow me to see everything

I am also considering of making it into a toy for kids. For example, in a bright room, it's off, and in a dark room, it turns on.
